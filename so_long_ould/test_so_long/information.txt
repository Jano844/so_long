mlx_init() --> make connection

mlx_new_window(takes the mlx_init pointer, Breite, HÃ¶he, "Name of window");



data.addr = mlx_get_data_addr(data.img, &data.bits_per_pixel, &data.line_length, &data.endian);
this command stores the image values, it takes the data.img and fills in the corrosponding bites_per_pixels, length of the line and the endian
So, in summary:

data.bits_per_pixel is set to the number of bits per pixel in the image.
data.line_length is set to the number of bytes per row in the image.
data.endian is set to the endianness of the image (byte order).
